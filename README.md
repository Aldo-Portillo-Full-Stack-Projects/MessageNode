# MESSAGE NODE

## This app uses MongoDB, Express, EJS, NodeJS, and Heroku

### This project helped me understand

- How to create a Node server
- How to use express to route the server
- How to use MongoDB to GET and POST messages
- How to deploy an app on Heroku using the Heroku CLI
- Learn a templating language (EJS)

### Things I will improve on

- I currently have the MongoDB URI in my code. I want to use an environment variable to hide the important information.
- Style the site to look better
- Add an autodelete feature after 24 hours
